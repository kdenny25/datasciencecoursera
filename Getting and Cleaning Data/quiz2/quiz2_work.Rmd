Question 1:

Register an application with the Github API here https://github.com/settings/applications. Access the API to get information on your instructors repositories (hint: this is the url you want "https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos"). Use this data to find the time that the datasharing repo was created. What time was it created?

This tutorial may be useful (https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/demo/oauth2-github.r). You may also need to run the code in the base R package and not R studio.

Code:
```{r}
library(httr)
library(httpuv)

oauth_endpoint("github")

# This includes appname, key and secret
myapp <- oauth_app("My Test App", 
                   key = "3a7ac605d6a25230b6f5",
                   secret = "199c831117651d200e9d5f505eec7499c92c03fe"
                   )

## Get OAuth credentials
github_token <- oauth2.0_token(oauth_endpoints("github"), myapp)

## Use the API
gtoken <- config(token = github_token)
req <- GET("https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos", gtoken)
stop_for_status(req)
content(req)


```
